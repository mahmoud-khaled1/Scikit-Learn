## Scikit-learn: is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.


# Step of any Project in machine learning :
   #1-Data File and attach data
   #2-Data Cleaning
   #3-Feature selection
   #4-Data Scaling
   #5-Data Splitting
   #6-Choice best algorithm (Regression-Classification-SVM-KMeans-.......)
